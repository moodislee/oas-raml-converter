Please note that you must provide all required fields including custom fields defined during the webinar creation. Use the API call ''Get registration fields'' to get a list of all fields, if they are required, and their possible values. At this time there are two versions of the ''Create Registrant'' call. The first version only accepts firstName, lastName, and email and ignores all other fields. If you have custom fields or want to capture additional information this version won''t work for you. The second version allows you to pass all required and optional fields, including custom fields defined when creating the webinar. To use the second version you must pass the header value ''Accept: application/vnd.citrix.g2wapi-v1.1+json'' instead of ''Accept: application/json''. Leaving this header out results in the first version of the API call.'

The default, if no type is declared, is single_session. A sequence webinar requires a "recurrenceStart" array consisting of a "startTime" and "endTime" for the first of the sequence, a "recurrencePattern" of "daily", "weekly", "monthly", and a "recurrenceEnd" which is the last date of the sequence (for example, 2016-12-01). A series webinar requires a "times" array with a discreet "startTime" and "endTime" for each webinar in the series. The call requires a webinar subject and description. The "isPasswordProtected" sets whether the webinar requires a password for attendees to join. If set to True, the organizer must go to Registration Settings at My Webinars (https://global.gotowebinar.com/webinars.tmpl) and add the password to the webinar, and send the password to the registrants.
