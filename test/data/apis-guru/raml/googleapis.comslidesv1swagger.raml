          Applies one or more updates to the presentation.

          Each request is validated before
          being applied. If any request is not valid then the entire request will
          fail and nothing will be applied.

          Some requests have replies to
          give you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do
          not need to return information; these each return an empty reply.
          The order of replies matches that of the requests.

          For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the
          third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies,
          the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order.

          Because other users may be editing the presentation, it is not guaranteed
          that the presentation will exactly reflect your changes: your changes may
          be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no
          collaborators, the presentation should reflect your changes. In any case,
          it is guaranteed that the updates in your request will be applied together
          atomically.

  CropProperties:
    description: |-
      The crop properties of an object enclosed in a container. For example, an
      Image.

      The crop properties is represented by the offsets of four edges which define
      a crop rectangle. The offsets are measured in percentage from the
      corresponding edges of the object's original bounding rectangle towards
      inside, relative to the object's original dimensions.

      - If the offset is in the interval (0, 1), the corresponding edge of crop
      rectangle is positioned inside of the object's original bounding rectangle.
      - If the offset is negative or greater than 1, the corresponding edge of crop
      rectangle is positioned outside of the object's original bounding rectangle.
      - If the left edge of the crop rectangle is on the right side of its right
      edge, the object will be flipped horizontally.
      - If the top edge of the crop rectangle is below its bottom edge, the object
      will be flipped vertically.
      - If all offsets and rotation angle is 0, the object is not cropped.

      After cropping, the content in the crop rectangle will be stretched to fit
      its container.

          ParagraphMarker at that index.
          The paragraph style of the new paragraph will be copied from the paragraph
          at the current insertion index, including lists and bullets.

          Text styles for inserted text will be determined automatically, generally
          preserving the styling of neighboring text. In most cases, the text will be
          added to the TextRun that exists at the
          insertion index.

          from the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane Private Use Area (U+E000-U+F8FF)
          will be stripped out of the inserted text.

      * A paragraph not in a list will inherit its paragraph style from the
        paragraph at the 0 nesting level of the list inside the parent placeholder.
      * A paragraph in a list will inherit its paragraph style from the paragraph
        at its corresponding nesting level of the list inside the parent
        placeholder.

      Inherited paragraph styles are represented as unset fields in this message.

          contained in the index range of a single `paragraph_marker` TextElement.
          In other words, a TextRun will never span multiple paragraphs.

      Represents the styling that can be applied to a TextRun.

      If this text is contained in a shape with a parent placeholder, then these text styles may be
      inherited from the parent. Which text styles are inherited depend on the
      nesting level of lists:

      * A text run in a paragraph that is not in a list will inherit its text style
        from the the newline character in the paragraph at the 0 nesting level of
        the list inside the parent placeholder.
      * A text run in a paragraph that is in a list will inherit its text style
        from the newline character in the paragraph at its corresponding nesting
        level of the list inside the parent placeholder.

      Inherited text styles are represented as unset fields in this message. If
      text is contained in a shape without a parent placeholder, unsetting these
      fields will revert the style to a value matching the defaults in the Slides
      editor.

          [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/). If the font name is
          unrecognized, the text is rendered in `Arial`.

          Some fonts can affect the weight of the text. If an update request
          specifies values for both `font_family` and `bold`, the explicitly-set
          `bold` value is used.

        description: |-
          The hyperlink destination of the text. If unset, there is no link. Links
          are not inherited from parent text.

          Changing the link in an update request causes some other changes to the
          text style of the range:

          * When setting a link, the text foreground color will be set to
            ThemeColorType.HYPERLINK and the text will
            be underlined. If these fields are modified in the same
            request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults.
          * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will
            also update the existing link to point to the new URL.
          * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link
            on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `"ABC\n123"`,
            will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The
            link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline.
          * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the
            style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding
            text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same
