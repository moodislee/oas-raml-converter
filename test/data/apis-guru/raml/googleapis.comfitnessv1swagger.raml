Every data point inserted into or read from this service has an associated data source.

      The data source contains enough information to uniquely identify its data, including the hardware device and the application that collected and/or transformed the data. It also holds useful metadata, such as the hardware and application versions, and the device type.

      Each data source produces a unique stream of data, with a unique identifier. Not all changes to data source affect the stream identifier, so that data collected by updated versions of the same application/device can still be considered to belong to the same data stream.

          - The application's package name or name. Package name is used when the data source was created by an Android application. The developer project number is used when the data source was created by a REST client.

In particular, the version of the hardware/the application isn't used. This allows us to preserve the same stream through version updates. This also means that two DataSource objects may represent the same data stream even if they're not equal.
