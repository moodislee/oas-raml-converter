For the definitions of read group sets and other genomics resources, see [Fundamentals of Google Genomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/fundamentals-of-google-genomics) Reads search operates over a genomic coordinate space of reference sequence & position defined over the reference sequences to which the requested read group sets are aligned. If a target positional range is specified, search returns all reads whose alignment to the reference genome overlap the range. A query which specifies only read group set IDs yields all reads in those read group sets, including unmapped reads. All reads returned (including reads on subsequent pages) are ordered by genomic coordinate (by reference sequence, then position). Reads with equivalent genomic coordinates are returned in an unspecified order. This order is consistent, such that two queries for the same content (regardless of page size) yield reads in the same order across their respective streams of paginated responses.

For the definitions of variants and other genomics resources, see [Fundamentals of Google Genomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/fundamentals-of-google-genomics) Each variant will be merged with an existing variant that matches its reference sequence, start, end, reference bases, and alternative bases. If no such variant exists, a new one will be created. When variants are merged, the call information from the new variant is added to the existing variant. Variant info fields are merged as specified in the infoMergeConfig field of the MergeVariantsRequest. Please exercise caution when using this method! It is easy to introduce mistakes in existing variants and difficult to back out of them. For example, suppose you were trying to merge a new variant with an existing one and both variants contain calls that belong to callsets with the same callset ID. // Existing variant - irrelevant fields trimmed for clarity { "variantSetId": "10473108253681171589", "referenceName": "1", "start": "10582", "referenceBases": "G", "alternateBases": [ "A" ], "calls": [ { "callSetId": "10473108253681171589-0", "callSetName": "CALLSET0", "genotype": [ 0, 1 ], } ] } // New variant with conflicting call information { "variantSetId": "10473108253681171589", "referenceName": "1", "start": "10582", "referenceBases": "G", "alternateBases": [ "A" ], "calls": [ { "callSetId": "10473108253681171589-0", "callSetName": "CALLSET0", "genotype": [ 1, 1 ], } ] } The resulting merged variant would overwrite the existing calls with those from the new variant: { "variantSetId": "10473108253681171589", "referenceName": "1", "start": "10582", "referenceBases": "G", "alternateBases": [ "A" ], "calls": [ { "callSetId": "10473108253681171589-0", "callSetName": "CALLSET0", "genotype": [ 1, 1 ], } ] } This may be the desired outcome, but it is up to the user to determine if if that is indeed the case.'

  Read:
    description: 'A read alignment describes a linear alignment of a string of DNA to a reference sequence, in addition to metadata about the fragment (the molecule of DNA sequenced) and the read (the bases which were read by the sequencer). A read is equivalent to a line in a SAM file. A read belongs to exactly one read group and exactly one read group set. For more genomics resource definitions, see [Fundamentals of Google Genomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/fundamentals-of-google-genomics) ### Reverse-stranded reads Mapped reads (reads having a non-null `alignment`) can be aligned to either the forward or the reverse strand of their associated reference. Strandedness of a mapped read is encoded by `alignment.position.reverseStrand`. If we consider the reference to be a forward-stranded coordinate space of `[0, reference.length)` with `0` as the left-most position and `reference.length` as the right-most position, reads are always aligned left to right. That is, `alignment.position.position` always refers to the left-most reference coordinate and `alignment.cigar` describes the alignment of this read to the reference from left to right. All per-base fields such as `alignedSequence` and `alignedQuality` share this same left-to-right orientation; this is true of reads which are aligned to either strand. For reverse-stranded reads, this means that `alignedSequence` is the reverse complement of the bases that were originally reported by the sequencing machine. ### Generating a reference-aligned sequence string When interacting with mapped reads, it''s often useful to produce a string representing the local alignment of the read to reference. The following pseudocode demonstrates one way of doing this: out = "" offset = 0 for c in read.alignment.cigar { switch c.operation { case "ALIGNMENT_MATCH", "SEQUENCE_MATCH", "SEQUENCE_MISMATCH": out += read.alignedSequence[offset:offset+c.operationLength] offset += c.operationLength break case "CLIP_SOFT", "INSERT": offset += c.operationLength break case "PAD": out += repeat("*", c.operationLength) break case "DELETE": out += repeat("-", c.operationLength) break case "SKIP": out += repeat(" ", c.operationLength) break case "CLIP_HARD": break } } return out ### Converting to SAM''s CIGAR string The following pseudocode generates a SAM CIGAR string from the `cigar` field. Note that this is a lossy conversion (`cigar.referenceSequence` is lost). cigarMap = { "ALIGNMENT_MATCH": "M", "INSERT": "I", "DELETE": "D", "SKIP": "N", "CLIP_SOFT": "S", "CLIP_HARD": "H", "PAD": "P", "SEQUENCE_MATCH": "=", "SEQUENCE_MISMATCH": "X", } cigarStr = "" for c in read.alignment.cigar { cigarStr += c.operationLength + cigarMap[c.operation] } return cigarStr'

  Status:
    description: 'The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be: - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs # Overview The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions. # Language mapping The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C. # Other uses The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different environments. Example uses of this error model include: - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client, it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial errors. - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose. - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each error sub-response. - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those operations should be represented directly using the `Status` message. - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.'

The union of reads returned for all sharded queries `[0, totalShards)` is equal to those returned by a single unsharded query. Queries for different values of `totalShards` with common divisors will share shard boundaries. For example, streaming `shard` 2 of 5 `totalShards` yields the same results as streaming `shard`s 4 and 5 of 10 `totalShards`. This property can be leveraged for adaptive retries.'
