              Generates a URL that can be rendered in an iframe to display the permissions (if any) of a product. An enterprise admin must view these permissions and accept them on behalf of their organization in order to approve that product.

              Admins should accept the displayed permissions by interacting with a separate UI element in the EMM console, which in turn should trigger the use of this URL as the approvalUrlInfo.approvalUrl property in a Products.approve call to approve the product. This URL can only be used to display permissions for up to 1 day.

        Pulls and returns a notification set for the enterprises associated with the service account authenticated for the request. The notification set may be empty if no notification are pending.
        A notification set returned needs to be acknowledged within 20 seconds by calling Enterprises​.AcknowledgeNotificationSet, unless the notification set is empty.
        Notifications that are not acknowledged within the 20 seconds will eventually be included again in the response to another PullNotificationSet request, and those that are never acknowledged will ultimately be deleted according to the Google Cloud Platform Pub/Sub system policy.
        Multiple requests might be performed concurrently to retrieve notifications, in which case the pending notifications (if any) will be split among each caller, if any are pending.
        If no notifications are present, an empty notification list is returned. Subsequent requests may return more notifications once they become available.

A user cannot install an app on a managed device unless the app is listed in at least one collection that is visible to that user.

      Note that the API can be used to directly install an app regardless of whether it is in any collection - so an enterprise has a choice of either directly pushing apps to users, or allowing users to install apps if they want. Which is appropriate will depend on the enterprise's policies and the purpose of the apps concerned.

      An Enterprises resource represents the binding between an EMM and a specific organization. That binding can be instantiated in one of two different ways using this API as follows: 
      - For Google managed domain customers, the process involves using Enterprises.enroll and Enterprises.setAccount (in conjunction with artifacts obtained from the Admin console and the Google API Console) and submitted to the EMM through a more-or-less manual process. 
      - For Android for Work Accounts customers, the process involves using Enterprises.generateSignupUrl and Enterprises.completeSignup in conjunction with the Android for Work Sign-up UI (Google-provided mechanism) to create the binding without manual steps. As an EMM, you can support either or both approaches in your EMM console. See Create an Enterprise for details.

  Entitlement:
    description: |-
      The existence of an entitlement resource means that a user has the right to use a particular app on any of their devices. This might be because the app is free or because they have been allocated a license to the app from a group license purchased by the enterprise.

      It should always be true that a user has an app installed on one of their devices only if they have an entitlement to it. So if an entitlement is deleted, the app will be uninstalled from all devices. Similarly if the user installs an app (and is permitted to do so), or the EMM triggers an install of the app, an entitlement to that app is automatically created. If this is impossible - e.g. the enterprise has not purchased sufficient licenses - then installation fails.

      Note that entitlements are always user specific, not device specific; a user may have an entitlement even though they have not installed the app anywhere. Once they have an entitlement they can install the app on multiple devices.

      The API can be used to create an entitlement. If the app is a free app, a group license for that app is created. If it's a paid app, creating the entitlement consumes one license; it remains consumed until the entitlement is removed. Optionally an installation of the app on all the user's managed devices can be triggered at the time the entitlement is created. An entitlement cannot be created for an app if the app requires permissions that the enterprise has not yet accepted.

      Entitlements for paid apps that are due to purchases by the user on a non-managed profile will have "userPurchase" as entitlement reason; those entitlements cannot be removed via the API.

  GroupLicense:
    description: |-
      A group license object indicates a product that an enterprise admin has approved for use in the enterprise. The product may be free or paid. For free products, a group license object is created in these cases: if the enterprise admin approves a product in Google Play, if the product is added to a collection, or if an entitlement for the product is created for a user via the API. For paid products, a group license object is only created as part of the first bulk purchase of that product in Google Play by the enterprise admin.

      The API can be used to query group licenses; the available information includes the total number of licenses purchased (for paid products) and the total number of licenses that have been provisioned, that is, the total number of user entitlements in existence for the product.

      Group license objects are never deleted. If, for example, a free app is added to a collection and then removed, the group license will remain, allowing the enterprise admin to keep track of any remaining entitlements. An enterprise admin may indicate they are no longer interested in the group license by marking it as unapproved in Google Play.
    properties:
      acquisitionKind:
        description: How this group license was acquired. "bulkPurchase" means that this group license object was created because the enterprise purchased licenses for this product; this is "free" otherwise (for free products).

Unapproved products will not be visible to end users in collections and new entitlements to them should not normally be created.'

  Install:
    description: |-
      The existence of an install resource indicates that an app is installed on a particular device (or that an install is pending).

      The API can be used to create an install resource using the update method. This triggers the actual install of the app on the device. If the user does not already have an entitlement for the app then an attempt is made to create one. If this fails (e.g. because the app is not free and there is no available license) then the creation of the install fails.

      The API can also be used to update an installed app. If the update method is used on an existing install then the app will be updated to the latest available version.

      Note that it is not possible to force the installation of a specific version of an app; the version code is read-only.

      If a user installs an app themselves (as permitted by the enterprise), then again an install resource and possibly an entitlement resource are automatically created.

      The API can also be used to delete an install resource, which triggers the removal of the app from the device. Note that deleting an install does not automatically remove the corresponding entitlement, even if there are no remaining installs. The install resource will also be deleted if the user uninstalls the app themselves.
    properties:
