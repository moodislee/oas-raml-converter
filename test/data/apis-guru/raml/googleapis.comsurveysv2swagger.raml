By specifying this property, you indicate the max price per response you are willing to pay in advance of the incidence test. If the price turns out to be lower than the specified value, the survey will begin immediately and you will be charged at the rate determined by the incidence pricing test. If the price turns out to be greater than the specified value the survey will not be started and you will instead be notified what price was determined by the incidence test. At that point, you must raise the value of this property to be greater than or equal to that cost before attempting to start the survey again. This will immediately start the survey as long the incidence test was run within the last 21 days.'
