  - title: Microsoft Azure Blob Service
    content: |
      The Blob service stores text and binary data as blobs in the cloud. The Blob service offers the following three resources: the storage account, containers, and blobs. Within your storage account, containers provide a way to organize sets of blobs.

      You can store text and binary data in one of the following types of blobs:

      - Block blobs, which are optimized for streaming.
      - Append blobs, which are optimized for append operations.
      - Page blobs, which are optimized for random read/write operations and which provide the ability to write to a range of bytes in a blob.

      For more information about block blobs and page blobs, see [Understanding Block Blobs, Append Blobs, and Page Blobs.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ee691964.aspx)

      Depending on what values you provide for **comp** and **restype** query params, response is returned as following:
      * **comp==list** and **restype not provided**: a list of containers under specified account
      * **comp==properties** and **restype==service**: storage service properties
      * **comp==stats** and **restype==service**: storage service stats
    queryParameters:
      restype:
        description: Used in conjunction with **comp==properties** for getting the stoage service properties
        enum: [service]
        default: service

      prefix:
        description: Filters the results to return only containers whose name begins with the specified prefix.
        required: false
      marker:
        description: |
          A string value that identifies the portion of the list of containers to be returned with the next listing operation. The operation returns the NextMarker value within the response body if the listing operation did not return all containers remaining to be listed with the current page. The NextMarker value can be used as the value for the marker parameter in a subsequent call to request the next page of list items.

          The marker value is opaque to the client.
        required: false
      maxresults:
        description: |
          Specifies the maximum number of containers to return. If the request does not specify maxresults, or specifies a value greater than 5,000, the server will return up to 5,000 items. If the parameter is set to a value less than or equal to zero, the server will return status code 400 (Bad Request).
        required: false
      include:
        description: |
          Include this parameter to specify that the container's metadata be returned as part of the response body.

          Note that metadata requested with this parameter must be stored in accordance with the naming restrictions imposed by the 2009-09-19 version of the Blob service. Beginning with this version, all metadata names must adhere to the naming conventions for [C# identifiers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa664670(vs.71).aspx).

      The **Preflight Blob Request** operation queries the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for the Blob service prior to sending the actual request. A web browser or another user agent sends a preflight request that includes the origin domain, method, and headers for the actual request that the agent wishes to make. If CORS is enabled for the Blob service, then the Blob service evaluates the preflight request against the CORS rules that the account owner has configured via [Set Blob Service Properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh452235.aspx), and accepts or rejects the request.

      For more information about CORS and the preflight request, see [the CORS specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support for the Azure Storage Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn535601.aspx)

      x-ms-lease-action:
        description: |
          The following values can be used:
          * **acquire**: Requests a new lease. If the container does not have an active lease, the Blob service creates a lease on the container and returns a new lease ID. If the container has an active lease, you can only request a new lease using the active lease ID, but you can specify a new x-ms-lease duration, including negative one (-1) for a lease that never expires.
          * **renew**: Renews the lease. The lease can be renewed if the lease ID specified on the request matches that associated with the container. Note that the lease may be renewed even if it has expired as long as the container has not been leased again since the expiration of that lease. When you renew a lease, the lease duration clock resets.
          * **change**: Change the lease ID of an active lease. A **change** must include the current lease ID in x-ms-lease-id and a new lease ID in x-ms-proposed-lease-id.
          * **release**: Release the lease. The lease may be released if the lease ID specified on the request matches that associated with the container. Releasing the lease allows another client to immediately acquire the lease for the container as soon as the release is complete.
          * **break**: Break the lease, if the container has an active lease. Once a lease is broken, it cannot be renewed. Any authorized request can break the lease; the request is not required to specify a matching lease ID. When a lease is broken, the lease break period is allowed to elapse, during which time no lease operation except **break** and **release** can be performed on the container. When a lease is successfully broken, the response indicates the interval in seconds until a new lease can be acquired.

          A lease that has been broken can also be released. A client can immediately acquire a container lease that has been released.
        required: false
      x-ms-lease-break-period:
        description: For a **break** operation, proposed duration the lease should continue before it is broken, in seconds, between 0 and 60. This break period is only used if it is shorter than the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time remaining on the lease is used. A new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may be held for longer than the break period. If this header does not appear with a **break** operation, a fixed-duration lease breaks after the remaining lease period elapses, and an infinite lease breaks immediately.
        required: false
      x-ms-lease-duration:

        required: false
      x-ms-proposed-lease-id:

            Beginning with version 2012-02-12, this value may be a URL of up to 2 KB in length that specifies a blob. The value should be URL-encoded as it would appear in a request URI. A source blob in the same storage account can be authenticated via Shared Key. However, if the source is a blob in another account, the source blob must either be public or must be authenticated via a shared access signature. If the source blob is blob is public, no authentication is required to perform the copy operation.

            Beginning with version 2015-02-21, the source object may be a file in the Azure File service. If the source object is a file that is to be copied to a blob, then the source file must be authenticated usign a shared access signature, whether it resides in the same account or in a different account.

            Only storage accounts created on or after June 7th, 2012 allow the Copy Blob operation to copy from another storage account.

            Here are some examples of source object URLs:
            * *https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob*
            * *https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?snapshot=<DateTime>*

            When the source object is a file in the Azure File service, the source URL uses the following format; note that the URL must include a valid SAS token for the file:
            * *https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare/mydirectorypath/myfile?sastoken*

            In versions before 2012-02-12, blobs can only be copied within the same account, and a source name can use these formats:
            * Blob in named container: */accountName/containerName/blobName*
            * Snapshot in named container: */accountName/containerName/blobName?snapshot=<DateTime>*

Any authorized request can break the lease; the request is not required to specify a matching lease ID. When a lease is broken, the lease break period is allowed to elapse, during which time no lease operation except break and release can be performed on the blob. When a lease is successfully broken, the response indicates the interval in seconds until a new lease can be acquired.

                In version 2012-02-12 and newer, **Put Blob** sets a block blob’s MD5 hash value even when the **Put Blob** request doesn’t include an MD5 header.
