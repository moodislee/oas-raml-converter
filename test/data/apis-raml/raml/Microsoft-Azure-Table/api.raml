      The **Preflight Table Request** operation queries the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for the Table service prior to sending the actual request. A web browser or another user agent sends a preflight request that includes the origin domain, method, and headers for the actual request that the agent wishes to make. If CORS is enabled for the Table service, then the Table service evaluates the preflight request against the CORS rules that the account owner has configured via [Set Table Service Properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh452240.aspx), and accepts or rejects the request.

      For more information about CORS and the preflight request, see [the CORS specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support for the Azure Storage Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn535601.aspx)
