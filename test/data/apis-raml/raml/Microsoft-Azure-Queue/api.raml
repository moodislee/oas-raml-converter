    content: |
      The Queue service stores messages that may be read by any client who has access to the storage account.
      A queue can contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size using version 2011-08-18 or newer. For previous versions, the maximum size of a message is 8KB. Messages are generally added to the end of the queue and retrieved from the front of the queue, although first in, first out (FIFO) behavior is not guaranteed.
      If you need to store messages larger than 64KB, you can store message data as a blob or in a table, and then store a reference to the data as a message in a queue.

      The **Set Queue Service Properties** operation sets properties for a storage account's Queue service endpoint, including properties for [Storage Analytics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh343270.aspx) and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules. See [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support for the Azure Storage Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn535601.aspx) for more information on CORS rules.

      Queries the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for the Queue service prior to sending the actual request.

      The **Preflight Queue Request** operation queries the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for the Queue service prior to sending the actual request. A web browser or another user agent sends a preflight request that includes the origin domain, method, and headers for the actual request that the agent wishes to make. If CORS is enabled for the Queue service, then the Queue service evaluates the preflight request against the CORS rules that the account owner has configured via [Set Queue Service Properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh452232.aspx), and accepts or rejects the request.
      For more information about CORS and the preflight request, see [the CORS specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support for the Azure Storage Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn535601.aspx).

          Specifies the method (or HTTP verb) for the actual request. The method is checked against the service's CORS rules to determine the failure or success of the preflight request.

      Access-Control-Request-Headers:
