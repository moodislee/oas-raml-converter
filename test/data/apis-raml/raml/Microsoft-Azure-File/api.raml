      The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is the preferred file share protocol used on premise today. The Microsoft Azure File service enables customers to leverage the availability and scalability of Azure’s Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) SMB without having to rewrite SMB client applications.

      The Azure File service also offers a compelling alternative to traditional Direct Attached Storage (DAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN) solutions, which are often complex and expensive to install, configure, and operate. Pricing for the new Azure File service is consistent with existing Azure Storage services and is charged in units of storage capacity and transactions. See the Azure Storage Pricing page for details.

      Files stored in Azure File service shares are accessible via the SMB protocol, and also via REST APIs, at the endpoint http|https://<account>.file.core.window.net. Note that HTTPS is recommended.

      While the Azure File service REST APIs are similar to the Azure Blob service REST APIs, there are minor differences related to how the service models the underlying file system. These differences are noted in the operations table below.

  get:
    description: |
      Depending on what values you provide for **comp** and **restype** query params, response is returned as following:
      * **comp==list** and **restype not provided**: a list of shares under specified account
      * **comp==properties** and **restype==service**: storage service properties
    queryParameters:
      restype:
        enum: [service]
        default: service
        required: false
      comp:
        enum: [list, propertie, stats]
        default: list
        required: true
      prefix:
        description: Filters the results to return only containers whose name begins with the specified prefix.
        required: false
      marker:
        description: |
          A string value that identifies the portion of the list of containers to be returned with the next listing operation. The operation returns the NextMarker value within the response body if the listing operation did not return all containers remaining to be listed with the current page. The NextMarker value can be used as the value for the marker parameter in a subsequent call to request the next page of list items.

          The marker value is opaque to the client.
        required: false
      maxresults:
        description: |
          Specifies the maximum number of containers to return. If the request does not specify maxresults, or specifies a value greater than 5,000, the server will return up to 5,000 items. If the parameter is set to a value less than or equal to zero, the server will return status code 400 (Bad Request).
        required: false
      include:
        description: |
          Include this parameter to specify that the container's metadata be returned as part of the response body.

          Note that metadata requested with this parameter must be stored in accordance with the naming restrictions imposed by the 2009-09-19 version of the Blob service. Beginning with this version, all metadata names must adhere to the naming conventions for [C# identifiers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa664670(vs.71).aspx).

      The **Set Blob Service Properties** operation sets properties for a storage account’s Blob service endpoint, including properties for [Storage Analytics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh343270.aspx) and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules. See [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support for the Azure Storage Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn535601.aspx) for more information on CORS rules.

      The **Preflight File Request** operation queries the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for the File service prior to sending the actual request. A web browser or another user agent sends a preflight request that includes the origin domain, method, and headers for the actual request that the agent wishes to make. If CORS is enabled for the File service, then the File service evaluates the preflight request against the CORS rules that the account owner has configured via [Set File Service Properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt427374.aspx), and accepts or rejects the request.

      For more information about CORS and the preflight request, see [the CORS specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Support for the Azure Storage Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn535601.aspx)
